Hi! This repository acts as a portfolio page for every interesting thing I have learned in school at USC. 

It mainly includes content from my CS or physics classes but also has small amounts of writing that I have done in my humanities courses. 

I log small tidbits of what I learn each day in class in hopes to track my learning and growth over-time!
